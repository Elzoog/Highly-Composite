# Highly-Composite
Java code for generating highly composite numbers very quickly

This is still somewhat of a work in progress because I want to experiment with some improvements.  However, this code is already quite fast. It can generate the first 1000 highly composite numbers in less than two minutes. After running it for 24 hours, I was able to generate the first 5258 highly composite numbers.

Since the code is good as is, I am uploading it for others to look at or use. Any improvements will be updated.
